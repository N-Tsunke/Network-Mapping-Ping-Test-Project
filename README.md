## Project Overview

This project demonstrates applied networking knowledge by mapping a home network, testing connectivity, and analyzing results using TCP/IP concepts.

**Objectives:**

- Map a home network topology
- Identify connected devices and IP configurations
- Test local and internet connectivity using `ping`
- Explain DNS, ICMP, and routing
- Document findings in a professional portfolio format

# Part 1: Network Mapping

### Step 1: Identify Connected Devices

Devices in the network environment:

- **Internet**  
- **Wi-Fi Router (Default Gateway):** 172.20.6.1  
- **Computer (IPv4 Address):** 172.20.6.168
