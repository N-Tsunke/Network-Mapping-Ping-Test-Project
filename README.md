## Project Overview

This project demonstrates applied networking knowledge by mapping a home network, testing connectivity, and analyzing results using TCP/IP concepts.

**Objectives:**

- Map a home network topology
- Identify connected devices and IP configurations
- Test local and internet connectivity using `ping`
- Explain DNS, ICMP, and routing
- Document findings in a professional portfolio format
